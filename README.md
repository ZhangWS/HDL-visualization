# Accessible Civic Participation
## GIS Visualizations with Folium and GeoPandas 

The [Democratic Party of Washington County, Oregon](https://www.washcodems.org) supports the Neighborhood Leader Program as well as the House District Leader (HDL) Program, both of which supports motivated Democrats to network with their neighbors and friends, provide them with credible sources of information, and encourage them to turn out at election time. House district leaders are experienced local leaders, and they are often the first point of contact for local residents when first becoming active in the Party. 

However, well-organized house district leader information is surprisingly hard to find. Local organizations rarely have the resources—i.e. willing volunteers with technical know-how—to combine all of the needed information and present it in an accessible manner, which has the potential of turning off busy local residents who have the interest but maybe not the time to devote to thorough research.

This is a demonstration of how open source visualization tools can be applied to the civic participation space. The result is a self-contained map of Washington County, Oregon, that contains easy-to-access information about a user's state house district and 'home' HDLs.
